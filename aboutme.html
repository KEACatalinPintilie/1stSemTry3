                Hi world!
                <br><br>

                I am just a man like all people, a man with qualities and defects, a man with human mistakes, with beautiful and ugly life experiences, a man with inner troubles and fears, and I love the people. And the human nature. I’m like you, Isn't it? And now I’m also a student. That's how I met you.<br><br>

                Smile, stranger. You are beautiful when you smile.<br><br>

                Photography and video and photography again, and music, and coffe. And learning. Something, anything. From you or someone else :) And books, movies and history. And S.F. and multiplayer games. And concerts/festivals and many other things. What about you? I'm curious.</p>
